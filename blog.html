    <h1>Blog</h1>
	<h2>May 3, 2015</h2>
	<p> Recently I have decided to further my programming skills and learn some more HTML and CSS. To that end I have begun re-booting my website. My old website was hosted over at Wordpress as is my current personal blog. After our advisor switched our lab website to Github I decided to re-do my website using Github Pages as well. This is the current attempt. In the coming week or so, you might see some changes since the development is an on-going process.  I have decided to keep my personal blog over at wordpress for now but I might switch that over in the future as well. So far this website is developed completely in HTML5 and CSS. If you like what you see, you should check out <a href="http://www.codecademy.com/learn" >Codeacademy</a>. It is a great resource for learning new languages. Most of what I have learned was learned through Codeacademy. It is great for anyone new to programming or people that have been programing but want to learn a new language. I encourage you to check it out. They cover other topics such as Ruby, Python and Javascript so there is plenty to learn. </p>
